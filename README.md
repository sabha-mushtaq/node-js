//index1.js :This project demonstrates my learning of Node.js and Express.js. It includes middleware logging, parsing form data, and handling GET and POST requests. JSON data is fetched, displayed in HTML, and updated dynamically using file operations with the fs module. Middleware is implemented for enhanced request handling and custom headers.

// index2.js : MongoDB and Express API
This project demonstrates how to connect MongoDB with Express.js to perform CRUD operations. Key features include:
Parsing JSON and URL-encoded data with middleware.
Defining a User schema using Mongoose.
Implementing routes to:
Create users (POST /post)
Fetch users (GET /fetchdata)
Update users (PATCH /patch/:id)
Delete users (DELETE /delete/:id)
This project helps me learn how to build a RESTful API using MongoDB and Express.

//mvc: This project is a simple Express.js application that demonstrates the use of MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. It implements routing, middleware for request/response logging, and MongoDB for database connection

// ssr

This project is a simple Student Management System built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. One of the key features I learned during this project is Server-Side Rendering (SSR) using EJS. This allows the application to dynamically generate HTML pages on the server and serve them to the client, enhancing performance and SEO.

// statefull authentication
MySignup - Node.js User Signup Application

Features
User registration and authentication.
Stateful authentication using server-side sessions.
MongoDB integration for user data storage.
JSON and URL-encoded body parsing.
EJS for rendering dynamic HTML pages.
Cookies management using cookie-parser.
