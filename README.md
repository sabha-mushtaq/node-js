//index1.js :This project demonstrates my learning of Node.js and Express.js. It includes middleware logging, parsing form data, and handling GET and POST requests. JSON data is fetched, displayed in HTML, and updated dynamically using file operations with the fs module. Middleware is implemented for enhanced request handling and custom headers.
// index2.js : MongoDB and Express API
This project demonstrates how to connect MongoDB with Express.js to perform CRUD operations. Key features include:

Parsing JSON and URL-encoded data with middleware.
Defining a User schema using Mongoose.
Implementing routes to:
Create users (POST /post)
Fetch users (GET /fetchdata)
Update users (PATCH /patch/:id)
Delete users (DELETE /delete/:id)
This project helps me learn how to build a RESTful API using MongoDB and Express.
